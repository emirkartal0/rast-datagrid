# Rast-Mobile Datagrid Project
This project is currently using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

I explained how I progressed through the project in the `proje-adımları.txt` file

## Requirements
Angular v17 supports node.js versions: v18.13.0 and newer

Angular v17 supports TypeScript version 5.2 or later

## Setup Scripts
```bash
1. npm install 
2. npm start
```

After `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
